## About The Project
In this project, you'll make a simpler version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. You can find an example in the workspace below. Try it out to get a feeling for how the game works!

In order to build a program like this, we should first completely understand what it does. Take a notepad out, and play the game multiple times. The game will present you some scenarios and ask you to make one of 2 choices, by entering 1 or 2. In your notepad, record what happens each time you make a certain choice.

As you can see, this is only a very short game with a couple of choices available to the player. We did that on purpose, to keep it simple. If we were making a complete game, we would expand it a great deal, and probably give the player a whole world to explore. But for this project, the idea is to focus on some key things that we need if want to make a working game:

The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
The game has conditions for winning and losing.
When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
These are the key features that your project will need to have in order to make it into a playable game. We'll go over each of them in more detail below.

As long as your program does all of the things listed in the instructions below, you are free to be as creative as you like!
